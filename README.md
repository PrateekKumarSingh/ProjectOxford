# Pre-Requisites
You need to do one-time registration for each Microsoft Cognitive Services API from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/sign-up">HERE</a>, before start using the module, because it won’t work without an API Key.

I would suggest to Save the API Keys into your Powershell $Profile so that it automatically loads every time the console is fired.
Below is a screenshot on – how to keep the API keys in your $Profile to make your life a bit easy
